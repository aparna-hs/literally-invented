## üêõ Known Issues & Open Bugs

### Browser Back Button Authentication Bypass
**Status:** üî¥ Open Issue  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** After logout, users can press browser back button to navigate to game pages. While server calls fail (no authentication), the pages still load and display content, creating a confusing UX.

**Attempted Fix:** Added useEffect authentication guards to redirect unauthenticated users to homepage, but the implementation didn't work as expected and was reverted.

**Impact:** 
- Users see game pages but can't actually play or save progress
- Confusing experience when server calls fail silently
- Not a security issue (server properly validates auth), but poor UX

**Next Steps:** Need to investigate proper React routing guards or authentication middleware approach.
