### Key Components
```typescript
// Level 1 Game Structure
interface Colleague { id: string; name: string; }
interface Description { id: string; text: string; emoji: string; }

// Drag & Drop Logic
- Descriptions fixed on top with drop zones
- Names shuffled at bottom for dragging
- matches object: { "description_id": "person_id" }
- Transformed for server: { "person_id": "description_id" }
```

### Scoring System
- **SQUAD SCANNER**: 10 points per correct match (max 170 points)
- **TIMELINE TAKEDOWN**: 10 points per correct year placement (max 180 points)  
- **CROSSWORD CONQUEST**: 10 points per correct word (max 120 points)
- **BLUFF BUSTER**: 10 points per correct FACT/BLUFF detection (max 130 points)
- **Leaderboard**: Sum of best scores across all challenges per user + temp scores for partial progress
- **Server validation**: All answers checked securely, scores saved automatically

## 🔐 Authentication System
```typescript
// Custom auth (not secure - for internal use only)
- Username/password stored in plain text
- Session stored in localStorage
- No JWT tokens or proper session management
- Users: Hardcoded team members with credentials
```

## 🚨 Known Issues

### 1. ~~Score Saving RLS Policy Issue~~ ✅ RESOLVED
- **Problem**: UPDATE operations return 0 rows affected
- **Cause**: Row Level Security policies blocking JavaScript client
- **Solution**: Implemented server-side scoring in database function
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Scores now saved automatically by database function

### 2. Security Concerns (Acknowledged)
- **Client-side auth**: Can be bypassed via localStorage manipulation
- **Plain text passwords**: Stored unencrypted in database
- **Database access**: Frontend has direct Supabase access
- **Acceptable for**: Internal team use only

## 📋 Common Tasks

### Adding New Team Members
1. Update `colleagues` array in Level1Game.tsx
2. Add entries to `game_answers` table in Supabase
3. Create corresponding descriptions in `descriptions` array

### Debugging Score Issues
1. Check browser console for validation logs
2. Verify `validate_level1_answers` function in Supabase
3. Check RLS policies on scores table
4. Test direct SQL queries in Supabase editor

### Updating Game Content
1. Modify colleague names in Level1Game.tsx
2. Update descriptions array with new content
3. Update database answers in game_answers table
4. Test server-side validation function

## 🐛 Current Issues Being Resolved

### Level 2 Server Validation Issue
- **Problem**: Database function returns false even for correct answers
- **Root Cause**: RLS policies on game_2_answers table blocking SELECT queries
- **Solution**: Disabled RLS on game_2_answers table with `ALTER TABLE game_2_answers DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`
- **Status**: Fixed - server validation now working correctly

### Key Technical Details for Level 2
- **Game Flow**: Name appears → user clicks year bucket → server validates immediately → shows ✅/❌ → next name
- **Database Design**: 
  - `game_2_answers`: Stores correct years for each person ID
  - `level2_temp_answers`: Temporary storage for individual answers during gameplay
  - Two-function system: `check_single_answer()` for instant feedback, `calculate_level2_score()` for final scoring
- **Security**: Join years hidden from frontend, validated server-side on each drop

---

## 🔮 Next Steps for Crossword Challenge

### Server Integration (PENDING)
1. **Create Supabase Tables**: `crossword_progress` and `crossword_answers`
2. **Move Answers to Server**: Remove hardcoded answers from frontend to prevent cheating
3. **Implement Auto-save**: Save progress every 10 seconds + on cell changes
4. **Add Validation Functions**: Server-side checking for individual words and full crossword
5. **One-time Play**: Restrict to single play per user like other challenges
6. **Results Modal**: Completion screen with final score and fun message

### Technical Notes
- **Intersection Logic**: Critical for crossword - shared letters between words must be preserved
- **Grid-based Validation**: Uses actual grid cells instead of answers object to handle intersections
- **Visual Feedback Flow**: Green (1s) → Grey (locked) for correct, Red (2s) → Clear for wrong
- **Grid Size**: 14x19 optimized for current word layout

---

## ✅ Recent Completion: Leaderboard Temp Scores (2025-09-07)

### Problem Solved
- **Issue**: Temp scores from partial Timeline Takedown progress weren't showing in leaderboard
- **Root Cause**: Complex client-side logic with foreign key relationship errors
- **Solution**: Created simple Supabase function `get_level2_temp_score()` and streamlined leaderboard logic

### Implementation Details
```typescript
// New Leaderboard Logic (simplified):
1. Get unique user_ids from level2_temp_answers
2. Get temp score for each user_id using get_level2_temp_score() function  
3. Get all completed scores from scores table
4. Add up scores by user_id (completed + temp)
5. Get display names from users table
6. Show top 10
```

### Key Benefits
- ✅ **Temp scores working**: Users with partial Timeline progress now show on leaderboard
- ✅ **Completed scores preserved**: All existing completed game scores still display correctly  
- ✅ **Simple & reliable**: No complex joins or client-side calculations
- ✅ **Server-side scoring**: Uses dedicated Supabase function for consistency

---

## ✅ Recent Addition: Bluff Buster Game (2025-09-07)

### New Game Implementation
- **🕵️ BLUFF BUSTER**: Complete FACT/BLUFF detection game added as Level 4
- **Game Mechanics**: One-by-one statement presentation, FACT/BLUFF choice buttons, immediate feedback
- **Team Focus**: 13 SI team members with personalized statements about each person
- **Scoring**: 10 points per correct detection (max 130 points)

### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Game Structure: Similar to Timeline Takedown pattern
- Auto-save progress during gameplay
- Server-side validation with immediate feedback  
- One-time play restriction when completed
- Progress restoration from temp answers table
- Custom SI-focused result messages
```

### Backend Structure

-- New Functions Added:
check_single_bluff_answer() - Individual answer validation
calculate_bluff_buster_score() - Final scoring and cleanup  
get_bluff_buster_temp_score() - Temp score for leaderboard
```

### UI Features

2. 🔍 SQUAD SCANNER (medium - name-description matching)  
3. 🕵️ BLUFF BUSTER (medium-hard - personal fact detection)
4. 🧩 CROSSWORD CONQUEST (hardest - intersecting clues)

Post-completion: All games → Results modal → HOME button → User choice
```

### Homepage User Experience
```
Authenticated users see:
- Personal greeting: "WELCOME USERNAME!"
- Live score dashboard: Total Score + Completed Challenges (X/4)

// New Features Added:
- Live total score calculation (completed + temp scores)
- Challenge completion counter (X/4)
- Includes temp scores from Timeline Takedown and Bluff Buster
- Loading state while fetching stats
- Only shows if user has points > 0
```

### User Engagement Features
- **Personal greeting**: "WELCOME USERNAME!" (no comma, cleaner look)
- **Achievement motivation**: Users see their progress on homepage
